# Country Catalouge

This program was written to gain experience working with personally written classes, data structures (ie. dictionaries, sets), and file I/O.

This code will hold country data that is extracted from a text file. It will then perform various actions on this data set like filtering countrys based on various variables. Adding/removing countries from the catalouge etc.

There is a test file to test the code and all of its methods to ensure everything is working correctly
